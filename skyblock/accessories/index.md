# Accessories

Accessories are special items that provide passive bonuses when in your inventory. They don't need to be equipped in your armor slots.

## Accessory Bag

The Accessory Bag is a special storage area where you can store your accessories while still receiving their benefits. You can upgrade your Accessory Bag to hold more accessories as you progress.
